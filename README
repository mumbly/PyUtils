Some python utilities. Well, at this point, only 1.

=======================

FileDupeFinder - find duplicate files given a directory root. Does a
check for files that are hardlinked. Uses an md5 checksum to determine
identity, which may not be a perfect method. Does a first pass of files
that uses filesize to determine if there is a potential duplicate (much
faster than doing md5 sums initially), which is definitely not a perfect
method.
